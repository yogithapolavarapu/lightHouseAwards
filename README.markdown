# Lighthouse at Night | HTML +  CSS + ParallaxJS

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/yogithapolavarapu/pen/eYZaoVw](https://codepen.io/yogithapolavarapu/pen/eYZaoVw).

I was originally going to make an SVG animation, but I thought I would have a go at CSS and torture myself. I also implement ParallaxJS so the user can distort the perspective.
